MTS PoSH Modules
=============

Modules with PowerShell functions for a variety of tasks.

These modules are ones I use personally and are not of the quality I generally want to share, however, people have asked me for them. This is the reason they are posted here. I make fixes and improvements to these on the fly as I use them. I will post updates periodically. Some of the functions in these modules come from various sources and I try to make sure they are given credit and make notations on my changes.

THESE MODULES MAY BE UPDATED WITH BREAKING CHANGES AT ANY TIME.

USE THESE MODULES WITH CAUTION. THE ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE TESTED THOROUGHLY IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MODULE OR HOW IT WORKS DO NOT USE IT OUTSIDE OF A SECURE, TEST ENVIRONMENT.
